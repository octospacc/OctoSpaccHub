<p>
    WuppìMini (temporary name?) is a minimalist, basic HTML-based frontend, designed for quickly and efficiently publishing to social media and content management services (note that only WordPress is currently supported).
    <br/>
    Mainly aimed at old systems that might not support modern web-apps, the server-hosted version of this application works without any client-side scripts, and should be optionally reachable via unencrypted HTTP.
    <br/>
    About practical use cases, you ask? I made this to upload game posts from my 3DS, and possibly microblog with my Kindle! (See an example: <a href="https://octospacc.altervista.org/2024/02/09/test-wuppimini/">this post</a> was published from my n3DS.)

<h3 id="h-versions">Versions</h3>
<p>
    This app uses a novel approach behind the scenes to be able to run in one of either two modes, while reusing a single codebase: a classical server-side-rendered application, which works well on very limited systems but requires connection with a dedicated backend server that runs it, or a modern client-side single-page-application, relying on many modern web technologies, but working without an hosting server. Occasional bugs or update delays aside, the two essentially have feature parity and the same interface, but can be useful in different situations. Use whatever you prefer in each possible situation.
