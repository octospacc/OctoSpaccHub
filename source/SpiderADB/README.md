    <b>SpiderADB</b> is an user-friendly webapp for connecting to devices via the Android Debug Bridge, straight from a browser.
    The aim of this is to be kind of a swiss army knife that can be used from any platform, with minimal hassle,
    to do a number of advanced administration and debugging task on Android devices. These are the current features:
</p><ul>
    <li><b>Devices</b>: Allows connecting new devices, shows a list of the paired ones, and lists basic useful information about various parts of the system.</li>
    <li><b>Terminal</b>: Provides a basic terminal shell for inputting commands and reading their output. (Currently doesn't support any teletype features, so only basic commands can be run properly.)</li>
    <li><b>Packages</b>: Displays a list of the currently installed packages, allowing for multiple to be uninstalled, and also allows uploading APK files for installation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some additional tips and tricks you might find useful to make the most out of this app:</p><ul>
